All Programming section solutions asked in Tech Mahindra off campus drive 2020 held in Nov-Dec20
1. Maximum Sum -  Write a program that adds up the largest row sum and the largest column sum from an N-rows * M-column array of numbers.
2. The Cuckoo Sequence - A Cuckoo Sequence is defined as shown: Cuckoo[1]=0 , Cuckoo[2]=1 , Cuckoo[n] = 1 * Cuckoo[n-1]+2 * Cuckoo[n-2]+3*1, for n>2. Given n (1<=n<=10^9) Calculate and return the nth term for the sequence.
3. Bitwise Operation - Given an integer, say N. You need to find the following.: The number of set bits (bits that are 1 in the bitwise representation) in N, The position of the least significant set bit, and The position of the most significant set bit. Print the output in a#b#c format where a,b,c are results from 3cases given.
4. Remainder Mod 11 - Given a string (of maximum length 1000) representing a larger number. Output its remainder modulo 11.
5. Caesar cipher - Given a ciphertext encrypted with Caeser cipher as input string find the corresponding plaintext and return the plaintext as output string.
6. Closest Pair - Find the closest pair in a given array.
7. Next Greater Number - Given a number 'N'(containing at most 10,000 digits), find the next greater number having the same digits.
