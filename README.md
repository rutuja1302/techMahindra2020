All Programming section solutions asked in Tech Mahindra off campus drive 2020 held in Nov-Dec20
1. Maximum Sum -  Write a program that adds up the largest row sum and the largest column sum from an N-rows * M-column array of numbers.
2. The Cuckoo Sequence - A Cuckoo Sequence is defined as shown: Cuckoo[1]=0 , Cuckoo[2]=1 , Cuckoo[n] = 1 * Cuckoo[n-1]+2 * Cuckoo[n-2]+3*1, for n>2. Given n (1<=n<=10^9) Calculate and return the nth term for the sequence.
3. Bitwise Operation - Given an integer, say N. You need to find the following.: The number of set bits (bits that are 1 in the bitwise representation) in N, The position of the least significant set bit, and The position of the most significant set bit. Print the output in a#b#c format where a,b,c are results from 3cases given.
4. Remainder Mod 11 - Given a string (of maximum length 1000) representing a larger number. Output its remainder modulo 11.
5. Caesar cipher - Given a ciphertext encrypted with Caeser cipher as input string find the corresponding plaintext and return the plaintext as output string.
6. Closest Pair - Find the closest pair in a given array.
7. Next Greater Number - Given a number 'N'(containing at most 10,000 digits), find the next greater number having the same digits.
8. Number of Selective Arrangements - Given a number n, find total number of De-arrangements of a set of n elements such that no element appears in its original position
9. Infix to Postfix - Write a program that takes input as a string containing an infix expression and returns the corresponding postfix expression.
10. Postfix Expression to value - Write a program that takes as input a string containing a postfix expression and returns the evaluated value of that postfix expression
11. Moving Apples - Given N number of baskets of apples, each containing different amount of apples. Return the minimum number of apples that must be moved so that all baskets have the same number of apples.
12. Longest Common Subsequence - Write a program which determines the length of the longest subsequence of 2 given strings.
13. Longest Palindromic Subsequence - Write a program to detemine the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string
14. Minimum Penalty - Write a program which accepts array of length N and returns the sum of all the differences between two adjacent elements.
15. Geometric Progression - Given first two terms and a integer n of the Geometric Progression series, the task is to print the nth term of the series.
16. Character Frequency Count - Given a string as an input, count the frequency of each letter and return a string with the format "character & count". For example: Input-"banana" Output-"a3b1n2"
